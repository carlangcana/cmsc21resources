# C Resources

Created by Carl Angcana. <br />
This repository is created to share all the C programming resources that I use in my instructional materials. <br /><br />

Special thanks to the people behind the UPLB Institute of Computer Science - CMSC 21 Course Outline. That is the basis of my codes.

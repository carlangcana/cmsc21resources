// Starters
// What is an array? Arrays in C is a collection of data of a single type stored in a contiguous memory location.
// Unlike in Python where an array can store different type of data (can have string, int, float, etc. in a single 
// array) C Arrays can only store one type of data which should be specified upon declaration.

int main(){
    int number[10];
